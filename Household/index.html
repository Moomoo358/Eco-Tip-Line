				<h1> Household Tips </h1>

				<p> A main way to be eco-friendly within the household is to switch from
					plastic bags to resuable bags. The plastic bags that you use at the store
					for your produce are too flimsy to be recylcyed properly. By investing in
					resuable bags you stray away from throwing out all the plastic bags you
					would have gotten from the store. Since many people tend to grab a good
					amount when it comes to bagging their produce. You put your apples in one,
					your cilantro in another, and before you know it you have over 10 of those
					flimsy bags in your cart. And you're know you are going to throw in the trash
					when you get home and clean your produce. Hence, save yourself the trouble
					and get that resuable bag!
